# DH150-assignment5
Main Design Challenge:

MyFitnessPal supports the activity of allowing users to input their meals and track how many nutrients they are intaking versus how many they need to sustain a healthy eating lifestyle, and recommends a diet plan that people can follow to eat healthy. If we are referring to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this activity fulfills the most basic need: physiological needs. It allows people to not only know what they are eating and what they should eat to be healthy, but helps people gain a general understanding of how to eat healthy and keeps a mental check on what they are eating. The traditional solution for this problem would be to manually track what you are eating by looking at nutrition facts of the food you are eating, then calculating how much you would need to eat for the rest of the day. However, not only is this method extremely tedious, but it's also much more prone to errors and doesn't promote users to continue tracking their eating habits. With technology like MyFitnessPal, the process is much easier since the user is only required to input how many servings of whatever food they are eating, and the app calculates the nutrients for them and displays it in a visually appealing way. 

Target users:

The target users for this activity are college students who are motivated to live a healthy lifestyle with not much experience or expertise in the subject matter. I chose this demographic/expertise level because it is the most applicable to who I am able to study, and it would serve a demand that many college students have: being able to live a healthy lifestyle while managing their time with the various other commitments they have. The users would ideally complete these tasks as they are eating or after they eat each meal, on a regular basis. To do this, they would simply pull out their phone and input their meal and serving size. 

For the context of the interview, I decided to interview my roommate during a meal at a UCLA dining hall. I chose this setting/environment to accurately model how/when a user should ideally be using the app, and because my roommate fit my target user group (motivated college students). 

Interview Script:

**Introduction:** The purpose of this interview is for us to get a understanding of how users approach the task of inputting meals they eat and tracking their calories/nutrients to live a healthy lifestyle. I'd love to interview you as a member of our target user group. 

**Background:** 

**What is your name, major, and year at UCLA?** 

Shalin Shah, and I'm a third year Computer Engineering major.

**How often do you exercise in a week?**

I exercise three times a week.

**Do you actively try to watch what you eat?**

Yes I try to, but sometimes it's difficult to consistently do it.

**Rate on a scale from 1-10 how important a healthy lifestyle is to you?**

8

**I'm going to ask you to complete a few tasks however you wish to. Please think out loud as you are doing the tasks.** 

Sounds good.

**First, please demonstrate and explain how you would go about tracking the calories and nutrients you gained from the meal we just ate.**

I use the app Lifesum, basically I just search the food in the app and add it to my diary. So if I search egg sandwich here, it appears in the search results and I just click add.

**Why did you choose this specific app?**

My friend used it, and I didn't want to find a new one so I used it too.

**What is the most important statistic you want to see from the food you ate? Why?**

How many calories I'm intaking. I want to track how many calories I eat in a day so I can gain a healthy amount of weight. 

**How do you decide the best way to find the meal in the app, if it's a unique meal?**

I usually try to look at the nutrition facts and see if it matches my meal most, but sometimes I get lazy and just add the first one I see.

**How much time do you usually spend inputting meals into this app?**

About 2 minutes. 

**Are you satisfied with the way the app presents your data?**

Sure, I like the circular display of calorie count and they also have useful nutrition facts down below. I wish there was a easier way to create a plan to track my progress, however. 

**Do you ever look back at the meals you've eaten to reflect?**

Not meals specifically, but I do look back to reflect on the calories I'm taking in. 

**Problems with inputting meals/Different kinds of searches to input:**

**Do you ever have a hard time finding a meal that you have eaten in the app?**

Yes, sometimes if I have some exotic food I can't find it in the app. I then have to input all the nutrition facts myself, which takes much longer and is a pain. 

**If given multiple options for a food you searched, how do you decide which is the right one?**

I choose the first one usually, because I don't want to spend too much time looking at all the details of the other options.

**Do you find yourself inputting the same meals multiple times, and if so, is there a way that the app makes this process easy?**

Yes, the app has a saved food section where I can quickly add past foods I have eaten without having to search for it again (for example, eggs for breakfast). 




Reflection/Summary:

The process went much smoother than I imagined it to go. Lifesum was an app I was not aware of, and it seemed like compared to the app I was studying, they surprisingly had a much cleaner user interface that allowed users to focus on the important details of their diet. One insight from the interview was that finding a plan to tell users how to meet their goals through the food they eat is a common problem. While users might be able to input food, they want an app that tells them what they SHOULD be eating to meet a specific goal that they are setting. This pain point is something that my redesign could focus on specifically. Next time, I would prepare more tasks to see exactly how the user goes about finding a difficult food, rather than just asking them how they do it usually. I would also try to interview multiple users in this group to see if the problems that they are having is similar among them, just to validate the problem further. Interview participants was an interesting way to learn about problems that I might not have thought of, and to remove the bias to the issue that I have when I'm approacing my designs.
