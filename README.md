Main Design Challenge:

MyFitnessPal supports the activity of allowing users to input their meals and track how many nutrients they are intaking versus how many they need to sustain a healthy eating lifestyle, and recommends a diet plan that people can follow to eat healthy. If we are referring to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, this activity fulfills the most basic need: physiological needs. It allows people to not only know what they are eating and what they should eat to be healthy, but helps people gain a general understanding of how to eat healthy and keeps a mental check on what they are eating. The traditional solution for this problem would be to manually track what you are eating by looking at nutrition facts of the food you are eating, then calculating how much you would need to eat for the rest of the day. However, not only is this method extremely tedious, but it's also much more prone to errors and doesn't promote users to continue tracking their eating habits. With technology like MyFitnessPal, the process is much easier since the user is only required to input how many servings of whatever food they are eating, and the app calculates the nutrients for them and displays it in a visually appealing way. 

Target users:

The target users for this activity are college students who are motivated to live a healthy lifestyle with not much experience or expertise in the subject matter. I chose this demographic/expertise level because it is the most applicable to who I am able to study, and it would serve a demand that many college students have: being able to live a healthy lifestyle while managing their time with the various other commitments they have. The users would ideally complete these tasks as they are eating or after they eat each meal, on a regular basis. To do this, they would simply pull out their phone and input their meal and serving size. 

For the context of the interview, I decided to interview my roommate during a meal at a UCLA dining hall. I chose this setting/environment to accurately model how/when a user should ideally be using the app, and because my roommate fit my target user group (motivated college students).
